Hello,
This is my first mini project I created After learning javascript from freecodecamp.org.

This project was a part of course, which I executed with improvisation so that i can get a complete hold of javascript.

This a chrome extension which lets you browser the web, and meanwhile store the wanted urls for future reference.

For trying this out you can just go to your chrome browser, click on your extensions on chrome and you can add this there.  
**make sure you copied this to your local environment**


**Please feel free to suggest anything and add any new ideas, i would be very glad**

Thank you
