Hello,
This is my first mini project I created After learning javascript from freecodecamp.org.

This project was a part of course, which I executed with slight modification so that i can get a complete hold of javascript.

This a chrome extension which lets you browser the web, and meanwhile store the wanted urls for future reference.

For trying this out you can just go to your chrome browser and load this extension.




Thank you
