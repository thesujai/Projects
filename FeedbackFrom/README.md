Hello,

This is a simple project in which i have created a feedback form/contact form along with user sign in/sign up features.
This is for learning purpose only.

Tools used:

1)Django  
2)SQL  
3)bootstrap  


You can try running this in your system by installing it locally and following the following proceduce:

1)Make sure Django, sqlite3 is properly installed in you system  
2)run python3 manage.py makemigrations  
3)run python3 manage.py migrate  
4)run python3 manage.py createsuperuser    ////then fill the required details  
5)run python3 manage.py runserver and you should be fine to go  

**You can use any other database also, just go to settings and change the db, you dont need to do any changes in orm for that**

**I am very open to suggestions if you have any for me, and you are free to add anything to this which will make me learn new things.**



Thank You
